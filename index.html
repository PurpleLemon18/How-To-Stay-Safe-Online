        <p id="cyberbullying">Staying safe online, should be on everyone's minds when they’re surfing the web. Whether you’re a seasoned expert, or a newcomer to technology - 
           hopefully there’s something you find useful amongst these pages. I’ll talk about a mix of the dangers online, along with the caution you should 
           exercise and even how to prevent or help if you find yourselves in one of these situations.<br><br> Internet safety or online safety or cyber safety 
           or E-Safety is trying to be safe on the internet and is the act of maximizing a user's awareness of personal safety and security risks to private 
           information and property associated with using the internet, and the self-protection from computer crime.</p>

        <p>As technology becomes more central to young people's lives, cyberbullying is on the rise. Access to technology means that cyberbullying can happen at any time — 
           a student's own home may not even be a safe place from bullying. While cyberbullying often takes place at home and after school hours, the impact can also be 
           felt in school. <br><br> Sadly we live in a world where everything is at our fingertips. This leaves us open, more than ever, to abuse. Cyberbullying has become a growing 
           problem since the 90’s, shortly after the introduction of the internet. If you find yourself or someone you know in a cyberbullying situation avoid
           escalating the situation. This means remain as neutrally assertive as you can. Remember, you can always remove yourself from the situation; block them, 
           log out, turn off your device. This will take the immediate bullying away. <br><br> You may or may not choose to seek comfort from friends or family. 
           The important thing to remember is that this is <b>BULLYING</b> and is not justifiable, if appropriate you can talk to a person with authority over the situation; 
           a teacher, your parents, or even the police. If you are struggling with the situation, the easiest step to take is to tell someone; this immediately takes some 
           pressure off you to control the situation.</p>

        <p>In the age of hashtags, likes, tweets, shares and snaps, online privacy can seem almost non-existent. We're sharing our lives through social media now more than 
            ever. If we're voluntarily handing over so much personal information, what's so important about online privacy? Your personal and financial information is highly 
            desirable to cyber criminals. With the theft of your identity, a cybercriminal may be able to access your banking details, obtain credit cards or loans and create 
            a trail of credit rating destruction all in your name. Stay smart online by keeping your friends close and your information closer.</p>
        
        <h1>Passwords</h1>

        <p>Thanks to modern technology, computing devices come in many different forms, such as desktop machines, laptops, smartphones, music players, and tablets. Any one of 
            these devices may connect with other computing devices and share information, and in many cases, they may also connect with banks to conduct financial transactions. 
            All of these machines are potentially vulnerable to misuse by unauthorized users, and therefore, users should always protect them with passwords.Passwords are a means 
            by which a user proves that they are authorized to use a computing device. A single device may have multiple users, each with their own password. Passwords are not 
            unlike a lock-and-key system, in which only the right key will enable a person to have access. The difference is that each person has a different key for the same door.

        <p><br><b>Why You Should Care About Online Privacy</b><br><br> Discussions about privacy, its relevance and its place in the world continue. Discussions often focus
            on the trade off between privacy and safety, the values individuals place on their own privacy and what they are willing to sacrifice in return for services they consider
            to offer more value. Wherever you place yourself on the privacy continuum – from ‘conspiracist’ to ‘publish everything’, there’s a chance you believe elements of your life 
            should remain personal. Many of us now – often unintentionally – contribute metadata to the various services we use. This data can be aggregated and anonymised but can be 
            used to cross match activities and build a profile of us as individuals. Unique identifiers of our personal lives include device information, location details, usage patterns,
            browsing behaviour, perceived loyalty to a service and much more. <br><br id="antiVirus"> Some internet users take a broad approach to their online privacy, for example, by giving social media
            sites and search engines a wide berth and restricting the information they voluntarily contribute to their own digital footprint. They may also choose to turn off devices 
            when not in use.If ‘threat modelling’ interests  you consider reviewing the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s ‘Surveillance Self-Defense’ guide.</p>
        
        <h1>AntiVirus</h1>

        <a class="link" href="https://www.staysmartonline.gov.au/protect-yourself/doing-things-safely/anti-virus-software" target="blank">https://www.staysmartonline.gov.au</a>
        <p>Anti-virus solutions differ in effectiveness and the range of malware types they cover. However, at a minimum, all anti-virus software should provide:

        <ul>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 1%;">Protection and detection capabilities for malware, adware and spyware</li>
            <li>Comprehensive anti-virus scanning.</li>
        </ul>
            
        Some anti-virus products may also include:
            
        <ul>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 1%;">A siteadvisor so your browser alerts you when visiting a suspicious or dangerous website</li>
            <li>Malware protection with an integrated firewall. (If you install an anti-virus product with firewall functionality, you may need to disable your operating system's built-in firewall. 
                See your anti-virus and operating system vendor for more details.)</li>
        </ul>
            
        <p>Before choosing an anti-virus product, consider reviews on reputable and trustworthy websites or magazines.</p>
